### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a mathematician with experience at banking and insurance industries. :chart:. Building bridges between theoretical ideas and practical applications is my passion :bridge_at_night:.

When I have time, I develop my Python skills working on small individual projects :snake:.

However, I've temporarily put on hold my activity on GitHub due to big changes in my personal life :baby:.
